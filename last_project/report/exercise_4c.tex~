\section{Numerical solution of the 20 x 20 Ising model}

Figure(\ref{fig:T_1}) and (\ref{fig:T_24}) shows the results for the mean energy and the absolute value of the magnetization for a system with $T = 1.0 k_B T$ and $T = 2.4 k_B T$ for different number of Monte Carlo cycles.
We can see that for temperature $T = 1.0 k_B T$ we get the same results for both random spins and all spins in one direction. This is not so strange because at $T = 1.0 k_B T$, 
our system will try to end up with all spins in one direction. The system with $T = 2.4 k_B T$ is a little bit different. Here the final system can be at many configuration that give
the same energy, so we need more Monte Carlo cycles to get the steady state. We see that for $10^6$ and higher we end up with the same $E$ and $|\mathcal{M}|$.\\
Figure(\ref{fig:Accepted_states}) shows the number of accepted energy states for $T = 1.0 k_B T$ and $T = 2.4 k_B T$ for random spin and for all spins in one direction. 
In the program we accept the new energy of the system if some random number $r \epsilon [0,1]$ is smaller or equal to a weight function $w = e^{-\Delta E /T}$. In the 
Ising model this $\Delta E$ can only take five different values $\Delta E = -8$, $\Delta E = -4$, $\Delta E = 0$, $\Delta E = 4$ and $\Delta E = 8$. So when all the spins are pointing
in the positive direction we get $\Delta E = 8$ which gives us $w = e^{-8} = 0.000335$ for $T = 1.0 k_B T$ and $w = e^{-8/2.4} = 0.0357$ $T = 2.4 k_B T$. This means that when $T = 1.0 k_B T$
and we have all spins in positive direction the probability to accept the new configuration is quite small. For $T = 2.4 k_B T$ and all spins in positive direction, $w$ is much greater
than for $T = 1.0 k_B T$, and the probability for accepting the new configuration is much greater. We can see that for $10^5$ Monte Carlo cycles and above, we have enough time to reach
its steady state and the effect of the initial configuration is small.\\
