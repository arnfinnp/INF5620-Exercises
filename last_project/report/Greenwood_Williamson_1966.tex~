\section{Greenwood-Williamson 1966}

\begin{itemize}
 \item Because of the roughness of the surface at microscopic scale, the actual contact area of two blocks in contact is much smaller than the nominal area.
 \item From Hertzian theory: \\(1) the area of contact spot depends on the radius of the asperity (is often unknown)\\ (2) the predicted variation of area with load proved to be incorrect.
\end{itemize}
