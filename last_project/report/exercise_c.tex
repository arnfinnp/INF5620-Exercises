\section{exercise c}

If we just drop the while-loop from b, we get a Picard iteration scheme with one iteration. 
\begin{lstlisting}
  u = Function(V)
  solve(a == L, u, bcs)
  u_k.assign(u)
\end{lstlisting}

So we just assign $u_k$ to be $u$. This will probably yield a high error.
The way we can solve the problem easy for both 1D, 2D and 3D without much problem is to 
implement this bit code

\begin{lstlisting}
degree = int(sys.argv[1])
divisions = [int(arg) for arg in sys.argv[2:]]
d = len(divisions)
domain_type = [UnitInterval, UnitSquare, UnitCube]
mesh = domain_type[d-1](*divisions)
\end{lstlisting}
