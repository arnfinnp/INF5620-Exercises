From fig.(\ref{fig:P_T1}) we can see that $\Delta E = 8$ dominates for $T = 1.0 k_B T$. This probably means that our system has all spins pointed in positive direction, and the
probability to accept the new configuration is very small. From fig.(\ref{fig:P_T24}) we can also see that $\Delta E = 8$ dominates, but not as much as for $T = 1.0 k_B T$. 
This is because when our system reaches steady state, most of the spins point in the same direction and the probability of getting $\Delta E = 8$ is larger than the probability of getting 
the other energies.\\
As we can see from fig.(\ref{fig:var}), the variance for $T = 1.0 k_B T$ is much lower and more stable than for $T = 2.4 k_B T$. This is because the system for
$T = 2.4 k_B T$ has a higher probability of getting $\Delta E \neq= 8$ then the system for $T = 1.0 k_B T$. This means that the system for $T = 2.4 k_B T$ will get more
energy fluctuations than the system for $T = 1.0 k_B T$.
