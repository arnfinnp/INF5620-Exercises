\section{Numerical solution of the 2 x 2 Ising model}

The algorithm is quite easy to program, it is actually just a few lines of code.

\begin{lstlisting}
  sum = 0
  for mc = 0,1,2,...,MC cycles
    for x = 0,1,2,...,Nx
      for y = 0,1,2,...,Ny
	i = some random number that is in the range of x
	j = some random number that is in the range of y	
	DeltaE = Change of energy when we flip the spin (i,j)	
	r = some random number [0,1]
	w = exp(-DeltaE/temperature)
	if r <= w
	  We keep the new spin configuration.
	  Update the system energy
	  Update the magnetization of the system	    
\end{lstlisting}

In fig.(\ref{fig:E_2x2}), (\ref{fig:abs_M_2x2}), (\ref{fig:Cv_2x2}) and (\ref{fig:X_2x2}) we can see how the results from our numerical Ising model converges towards some value for 
$E$, $|\mathcal{M}|$, $C_V$ and $\chi$. In table (\ref{table:ex_b}) I compare the results from the $2 \times 2$ numerical Ising model with the analytical $2 \times 2$ numerical Ising model.
As we can see, the results from the numerical solution is quite good for $10^6$ Monte Carlo cycles and higher. We can see that something strange is happening at $10^4$ Monte Carlo cycles,
so it is not a good idea to use less than $10^5$ Monte Carlo cycles. When we decide how many Monte Carlo cycles we would like to use in our program, we have to decide how much getting 
very good results is worth to us compared to the time it takes us to get the results. If we use $10^9$ Monte Carlo cycles the program will use $1000$ times more time than if we use
$10^6$ Monte Carlo cycles. For bigger systems this can be a big deal.
